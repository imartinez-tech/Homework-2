Ibraim Martinez's Website. 
In this website so far what you will find is a picture of Ibraim Martinez with a hat made out of plantain leaves when he visited the Dominican Republic. Scrolling down the page you will also find a picture taken of a 2017 Audi where Ibraim is finishing up the service on the vehicle. Next you'll find another picture of an engine being taking apart to replace piston rings because the engine is consuming oil. Next will be the boring parts where you'll be able to find information on how to contact him. Lastly there's is section for the resume, which is not yet completed.
